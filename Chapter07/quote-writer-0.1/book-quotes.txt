Kubectl is pronounced kube-control, but the softer souls in the community prefer to call it kubecuddle. Some refer to it as kube-C-T-L.
%
Two types of hypervisors exist. Type 1 hypervisors don’t require running a host OS, while type 2
hypervisors do.
%
This can’t happen in Kubernetes, because it requires that swap is disabled on all the nodes.
%
Even seemingly harmless operations such as changing permissions or ownership of a file result
in a new copy of the entire file being created in the read/write layer. If you perform this type of operation on
a large file or many files, the image size may swell significantly.
%
Docker Desktop for Windows can run either Windows or Linux containers. Make sure that you
configure it to use Linux containers.
%
If you want to run an image from a different registry, you must specify the registry along with the
image name. For example, if you want to run an image from the Quay.io registry, which is another publicly
accessible image registry, run it as follows: docker run quay.io/some/image.
%
The docker run command only pulls the image if it hasn’t already pulled it before. Using the
%
The hostname in the response is the server’s actual hostname, not the one sent by the client in the
request’s Host header. This detail will be important later.
%
Don’t add unnecessary files to the build directory, as they will slow down the build process—especially if
the Docker daemon is located on a remote system.
%
Each directive creates a new layer. I have already mentioned that when you delete a file, it is only
marked as deleted in the new layer and is not removed from the layers below. Therefore, deleting a file with
a subsequent directive won’t reduce the size of the image. If you use the RUN directive, make sure that the
command it executes deletes all temporary files it creates before it terminates.
%
If the Docker Daemon runs on a different machine, you must replace localhost with the IP of that
%
The shell’s executable file must be available in the container’s file system. This isn’t always the case
with containers running in production.
%
If you use macOS or Windows, you must list the processes in the VM that hosts the Docker daemon,
as that’s where your containers run. In Docker Desktop, you can enter the VM using the following command:
docker
%
Entering a running container like this is useful when debugging an app running in a container. When
something breaks, the first thing you’ll want to investigate is the actual state of the system your application
sees.
%
With Docker you create a privileged container by using the --privileged flag.
%
Always follow the principle of least privilege when running containers. Don’t give them any
capabilities that they don’t need. This prevents attackers from using them to gain access to your operating
system.
%
Although technically not a cluster, the single-node Kubernetes system provided by Docker Desktop
should be enough to explore most of the topics discussed in this book. When an exercise requires a multinode cluster, I will point this out.
%
The initial installation of the cluster takes several minutes, as all container images for the Kubernetes
components must be downloaded.
%
If you configure Minikube to use a VM, you don’t need Docker, but you do need a hypervisor like
VirtualBox. In the other case you need Docker, but not the hypervisor.
%
If you use Linux, you can reduce the resources required by Minikube by creating the cluster without a VM.
Use this command: minikube start --vm-driver none
%
If you want to list containers using your local docker CLI instance, as in the case of Docker Desktop, run
the following command: eval $(minikube docker-env)
%
Docker must be installed on your system to use kind.
%
Due to width restrictions, the node names control-plane, worker1, and worker2 are used
%
Certain operations (the one in step 2, for example) may take a few minutes to complete, so relax
and grab a coffee in the meantime.
%
I’m creating all three worker nodes in the same zone, but you can also spread them across all zones
in the region by setting the compute/zone config value to an entire region instead of a single zone. If you
%
Each VM incurs costs. To reduce the cost of your cluster, you can reduce the number of nodes to one, or
even to zero while not using it. See next section for details.
%
You can always append --help to any kubectl command to get information on what it does and how
to use it.
%
You may not need an alias if you used gcloud to set up the cluster. It installs the k binary in
%
If you want to use several Kubernetes clusters (for example, both Minikube and GKE), see appendix A
for information on switching between different kubectl contexts.
%
Executing the describe command without specifying the object name is useful when only one object
of a certain type exists. You don’t have to type or copy/paste the object name.
%
This command must be run in Windows PowerShell.
Find the token listed under kubernetes-dashboard-token-xyz and paste it into the token
field on the authentication page shown in your browser. After you do this, you should be able
to use the dashboard. When you’re finished using it, terminate the kubectl proxy process
using Control-C.
%
Make sure that the image is stored in a public registry and can be pulled without access authorization.
You’ll learn how to provide credentials for pulling private images in chapter 8.
%
Notice the use of the abbreviation svc instead of services. Most resource types have a short
%
If you deployed your cluster with Docker Desktop, the load balancer’s IP address is shown as
localhost, referring to your Windows or macOS machine, not the VM where Kubernetes and the
%
If you use Docker Desktop, the service is available at localhost:8080 from within your host
operating system. Use curl or your browser to access it.
%
If you omit the --url option when running the minikube service command, your browser opens
%
If you use Docker Desktop, the VM running Kubernetes can’t be reached from your host OS through
the VM’s IP. You can access the service through the node port only within the VM by logging into it using the
special container as described in section 3.1.1.
%
You can also use the -o wide output option to see additional information when listing other object
types.
%
The app itself must support horizontal scaling. Kubernetes doesn’t magically make your app scalable;
it merely makes it trivial to replicate it.
%
Because the term “resource” can also refer to compute resources, such as CPU and memory, to
reduce confusion, the term “objects” is used in this book to refer to API resources.
%
Although the figure shows that users write to the object’s Spec section and read its Status, the API
server always returns the entire object when you perform a GET request; to update the object, you also send
the entire object in the PUT request.
%
Node objects are slightly different from other objects because they are usually created by the Kubelet
- the node agent running on the cluster node - rather than by users. When you add a machine to the cluster,
the Kubelet registers the node by creating a Node object that represents the host. Users can then edit (some
of) the fields in the Spec section.
%
Use the -o json option to display the object in JSON instead of YAML.
In the listing, the four main sections of the object definition and the more important
properties of the node are annotated to help you distinguish between the more and less
important fields. Some lines have been omitted to reduce the length of the manifest.
%
If you want to see the complete structure of an object (the complete hierarchical list of fields without
the descriptions), try kubectl explain pods --recursive.
%
The jq tool is very handy if you want to see only a part of the object’s structure. For example, to display
the node’s status conditions, you can run kubectl
%
Conditions are usually orthogonal, meaning that they represent unrelated aspects of the object.
If the state of an object were represented as a single field, it would be very difficult to
subsequently extend it with new values, as this would require updating all clients that
monitor the state of the object and perform actions based on it. Some object kinds originally
used such a single field, and some still do, but most now use a list of conditions instead.
Since the focus of this chapter is to introduce the common features of the Kubernetes API
objects, we’ve focused only on the conditions field, but it is far from being the only field in
the status of the Node object. To explore the others, use the kubectl explain command as
%
The amount of time to retain events is configurable via the API server’s command-line options.
%
If you want to follow the exercises in this section in your own cluster, you may need to restart one of
the nodes to ensure that the events are recent enough to still be present in etcd. If you can’t do this, don’t
worry, and just skip doing these exercises yourself, as you’ll also be generating and inspecting events in the
exercises in the next chapter.
%
The previous listing uses the short name ev in place of events.
You’ll notice that some events displayed in the listing match the status conditions of the
Node. This is often the case, but you’ll also find additional events. The two events with the
reason Starting are two such examples. In the case at hand, they signal that the Kubelet
%
As you complete the exercises throughout this book, you may find it useful to run the kubectl get
%
When containers of the same pod use separate PID namespaces, they can’t see each other or send
process signals like SIGTERM or SIGINT between them.
%
You’ll create this pod in section 5.4.
Another example, shown in figure 5.7, is a pod where the primary container runs a web
server that serves files from its webroot directory. The other container in the pod is an agent
that periodically downloads content from an external source and stores it in the web server’s
webroot directory. As I mentioned earlier, two containers can share files by sharing a
volume. The webroot directory would be located on this volume.
%
You’ll create this pod in the chapter 7.
%
The decision whether to use YAML or JSON to define your objects is yours. Most people prefer to use
YAML because it’s slightly more human-friendly and allows you to add comments to the object definition.
%
Whenever you want to create a pod manifest from scratch, you can also use the following command to
create the file and then edit it to add more fields: kubectl run kiada --image=luksa/kiada:0.1
%
You can also modify the command to run the bash shell in the client pod and then run curl from the
%
The kubectl port-forward command can also forward connections to services instead of pods
and has several other useful features. Run kubectl port-forward --help to learn more.
%
The application in the container must be bound to a port on the loopback device for the Kubelet to
reach it. If it listens only on the pod’s eth0 network interface, you won’t be able to reach it with the
kubectl port-forward command.
%
You can display timestamps by only typing --timestamps without the value. For boolean options,
merely specifying the option name sets the option to true. This applies to all kubectl options that take a
Boolean value and default to false.
%
Kubectl options that take a value can be specified with an equal sign or with a space. Instead of -tail=10, you can also type --tail 10.
%
Depending on your cluster configuration, the log files may also be rotated when they reach a certain
size. In this case, kubectl logs will only display the new log file. When streaming the logs, you must
restart the command to switch to the new file.
%
The kubectl cp command requires the tar binary to be present in your container, but this
requirement may change in the future.
%
TO MEAP READERS Ephemeral containers are currently an alpha feature, which means they may
change or even be removed at any time. This is also why they are currently not explained in this book. If they
graduate to beta before the book goes into production, a section explaining them will be added.
%
Like the kubectl exec command, kubectl attach also supports the --tty or -t option, which
%
An additional field in the container definition, stdinOnce, determines whether the standard input
channel is closed when the attach session ends. It’s set to false by default, which allows you to use the
%
If you don’t provide the name, kubectl exec defaults to the first container specified in the pod
manifest.
%
Container names must be unique within the union of all init and regular containers.
%
By default, the kubectl delete command waits until the object no longer exists. To skip the wait, run
the command with the --wait=false option.
%
If you’re familiar with Docker, you may wonder if you can stop a pod and start it again later, as you
can with Docker containers. The answer is no. With Kubernetes, you can only remove a pod completely and
create it again later.
%
You can also apply several files at the same time using this syntax (for example: kubectl apply f kiada.yaml,kiada-ssl.yaml).
%
Use the --recursive flag to also scan subdirectories.
%
You can specify multiple object types in the delete command. For example, you can use kubectl
delete events,all --all to delete events along with all object kinds included in all.
%
Remember the jq tool? You can use it instead to print out the value of the phase field like this:
kubectl get po kiada -o json | jq .status.phase
%
You can also display the container status(es) using jq like this: kubectl get po kiada -o json
| jq .status.containerStatuses
%
If one of the pod’s containers fails, the other containers continue to run.
Now examine the output of the kubectl get events -w command you ran earlier. It is
%
Any data that the process writes to the container’s filesystem is lost when the container is recreated.
This behavior is sometimes undesirable. To persist data, you must add a storage volume to the pod, as
explained in the next chapter.
%
If init containers are defined in the pod and one of the pod’s regular containers is restarted, the init
containers are not executed again.
%
Surprisingly, the restart policy is configured at the pod level and applies to all its containers. It can’t be
configured for each container individually.
%
The delay is reset to zero when the container has run successfully for 10 minutes. If the container
must be restarted later, it is restarted immediately.
%
When you tell Envoy to terminate, it terminates with exit code zero, which means it hasn’t crashed.
The CrashLoopBackOff status can therefore be misleading.
%
Liveness probes can only be used in the pod’s regular containers. They can’t be defined in init
containers.
%
In addition to a liveness probe, a container may also have a startup probe, which is discussed in
section 6.2.6, and a readiness probe, which is explained in chapter 10.
%
As you can see in the envoy container’s liveness probe, you can specify the probe’s target port by
name instead of by number.
%
Exit code 128+n indicates that the process exited due to external signal n. Exit code 137 is 128+9,
%
If the startup probe fails often enough to reach the failureThreshold, the container is terminated
as it the liveness probe had failed.
%
Make sure that the /healthz HTTP endpoint doesn’t require authentication; otherwise the probe will
always fail, causing your container to be restarted indefinitely.
%
When running a Java application in your container, you may want to use an HTTP GET probe instead of
an exec liveness probe that starts an entire JVM. The same applies to commands that require considerable
computing resources.
%
The same as with liveness probes, lifecycle hooks can only be applied to regular containers and not to
init containers. Unlike probes, lifecycle hooks do not support tcpSocket handlers.
%
Because the state of a pod can change quickly, inspecting just its status may not tell you everything you
need to know. Rather than inspecting the state at a particular moment in time, reviewing the pod’s events is
usually a better way to get the full picture.
%
You can’t specify both an exec and an httpGet post-start hook for a container. You can only specify
%
Using an HTTP GET post-start hook with applications that don’t immediately start accepting
connections can cause the container to enter an endless restart loop.
%
When container termination is initiated, the liveness and other probes are no longer invoked.
%
If successful completion of the pre-stop hook is critical to the proper operation of your system, make
sure that it runs successfully. I’ve experienced situations where the pre-stop hook didn’t run at all, but the
engineers weren’t even aware of it.
%
If the imagePullPolicy is set to Always and the image registry is offline, the container will
%
If the container needs to be restarted and imagePullPolicy is set to Always, the container image
%
If one of the container images can’t be pulled, the other containers run anyway.
Containers don’t necessarily start at the same moment. If pulling the image takes a long time,
the container may start well after all the others have already started. Bear this in mind if one of your
containers depends on another.
%
A reduction of the termination grace period is rarely necessary. However, it is advisable to extend it if the
application usually needs more time to shut down gracefully.
%
If you set the termination grace period to zero, the pod’s pre-stop hooks are not executed.
%
You should make sure that your init containers also handle the TERM signal so that they shut down
immediately if you delete the pod object while it’s still being initialized.
%
Before you mount a volume in a container to preserve files across container restarts, consider how this
affects the container’s self-healing capability.
%
The emptyDir field in the volume definition defines neither of these properties. The curly braces {}
%
To adapt this exercise for use with other cloud providers, use the appropriate volume type supported by
the cloud provider. Consult the documentation provided by the cloud provider to determine how to create the
storage volume and how to mount it into the pod.
